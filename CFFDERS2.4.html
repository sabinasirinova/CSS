    <h2>Conception and Creation</h2>
    <p>When Nintendo was working on Miyamoto's game, Donkey Kong Miyamoto had to create a character to play with. So after coming up with the idea of a carpenter so that people could recognize who he is. Mario's clothes were made the way they are now because of limitations of the Donkey Kong game. Miyamoto gave Mario a mustache because he couldn't draw a mouth. He gave Mario a big nose so that he would appear human. He then gave Mario a hat because he didn't want to draw hair. The overalls were given as Mario's clothing so his arms could be seen swinging back and forth when walking. Later Miyamoto decided to change Mario's occupation to a plumber because of his overalls and showed this in the arcade game Mario Bros., and the setting being in the sewers. Before Mario Bros. Nintendo wanted to give Mario a better name then Jumpman. So they decided to name him Mario after Nintendo of America's Italian landlord Mario Segale for their similar appearances.</p>
    <h2>Girlfriend, Ape and Construction Site</h2>
    <p>Mario first appeared in the arcade game Donkey Kong which becomes the second best selling arcade game of all time. The ape Donkey Kong had kidnappped Mario's girlfriend, Pauline and took her to the top of a construction site. Mario had to climb the large structure to try and rescue Pauline. Donkey Kong threw barrels and other objects down the girders to try and stop the carpenter. Every time Mario got to the top, Donkey Kong took Pauline higher up of the place. Eventually Mario was able to make the girders that Donkey Kong stood on come down and he fell and got knocked unconscious. Mario took Pauline with him and they finished their date.</p>

    <h2>Saving the Mushroom</h2>
    <p>In Super Mario Bros. Mario and Luigi arrive in a new land called the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario finds out that the land has been attacked by Koopas. The King of Koopas, Bowser has used black magic to turn the kingdom's citizens into different objects such as brick blocks or ? blocks. Mario heads across the kingdom to save Princess Peach Toadstool who was kidnapped by Bowser because she can stop the black magic. Mario and Luigi can use Super Mushrooms to become bigger and use Fire Flowers to shoot fireballs. Mario goes through the land and defeats the False Bowsers in each castle saving the Mushroom Retainers. Mario finally arrives at the last castle and faces the real Bowser in battle. He is defeated the same way by using the axe to cut the bridge knocking him into lava sending him to a fiery death. Mario then frees the princess. In the original Super Mario Bros. 2 the story, graphics and gameplay are the same. Somethings are different like Poison Mushrooms and wind and Bloopers swimming in the sky.</p>
