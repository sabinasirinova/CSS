    <h1 class="title">Macintosh</h1>
    <p>
      The Macintosh (mainly Mac since 1998) is a family of personal computers
      designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. since January 1984.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Macintosh is the first successful mass-market personal
      computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and
      mouse. Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular Apple II family of
      computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993.
